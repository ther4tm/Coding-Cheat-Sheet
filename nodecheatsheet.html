To evaluate multi line input you need to press <span class="attribute">ctrl + d</span>.<br/><br/>This is useful for many things including performing calculations or developing code.</td>

To run this without Node you would need to wrap this into HTML in order for it to be executed and have the answer computed. It's a lot of extra coding.<br/><br/>The Node environment allows us to execute a programme without having to embed it.<br/>In the terminal we simply enter the Node environment (by typing <span class="attribute">node</span>) and then enter the file name we wish to execute.<br/><br/><span class="attribute">node exampleProgramme.js</span><br/><br/>One thing to bear in mind here is that we need to be aware of our location in the file system, the file name to be executed will only be whatever directory you are in within the terminal, so if you wanted to execute a file in another folder from the one you are in within terminal you would need to enter the rest of its location parameters (for example something like <span class="attribute">/users/documents/exampleFile.js</span>)</td>

This is used to print whatever is within the parentheses to the terminal.<br/><br/>The <span class="attribute">.assert()</span> method prints a message to the terminal if the value within the parentheses is falsey. This can quickly check on the truthy or falsey nature of something.<br/><br/>The <span class="attribute">.table()</span> method prints out a table in the terminal based on whatever array or object is enclosed within the parentheses. This is a easy visual way to see the hierarchy of an object or array.</td>

                            <td>The Process module</td>
                            <td>The process module is also a global module within node and can be accessed without the need to be required in first.<br/><br/>This module has tools for evaluating the current process, things like assessing the memory usage, the development phase or the file location.<br/><br/>The <span class="attribute">process.env</span> property is an object which stores and controls information about the environment in which the process is currently running. For example, the <span class="attribute">process.env</span> object contains a <span class="attribute">PWD</span> property which holds a string with the directory in which the current process is located. It can be useful to have some if/else logic in a program depending on the current environment.<br/>For example, a web application in a development phase might perform different tasks than when it’s live to users. We could store this information on the <span class="attribute">process.env</span>.<br/>A common convention is to add a property to <span class="attribute">process.env</span> with the key <span class="attribute">NODE_ENV</span> and a value of either production or development.<br/> This is done in the same way that Javascript objects are amended, if a key does not exist it will be created and if it exists it will be mutated.<br/>So we could write <span class="attribute">process.env.NODE_ENV = 'development';</span> which will then create the <span class="attribute">NODE_ENV</span> key and assign it the property of <span class="attribute">'development'</span>. We can then apply some if/else logic to something that we are working on in the background as a quick check against development or production deployment.<br/>For example;<br/><span class="attribute">if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'){<br/>console.log('Testing! Testing! Does everything work?');<br/>}</span><br/><br/>The <span class="attribute">.memoryUsage()</span> method returns information on the CPU demands of the current process in the form of an object. The object looks like the following;<br/><br/><span class="attribute">{ rss: 26247168,<br/>heapTotal: 5767168,<br/>heapUsed: 3573032,<br/>external: 8772 }</span><br/><br/>The values of the properties will differ however we can use this information to assess CPU usage.<br/><br/><span class="attribute">process.argv</span> holds an array of command line values.<br/>This means that whatever we type into the command line can then be used back in whatever programme we are executing.<br/>For example if we have a javascript file (app.js) that simply has the line <span class="attribute">console.log(process.argv[3]);</span>, if we type into the command line <span class="attribute">node app.js testing feature</span> the following will happen;<br/>node will execute the file app.js which in turn runs the <span class="attribute">console.log()</span> method which logs the 3rd index item to the terminal found with the <span class="attribute">process.argv</span> method contained within its parentheses. the 3rd index item refers to the 4th word written in the command line which is held in the <span class="attribute">process.argv</span> array. This means the word feature will be printed to the terminal.<br/><br/>There are additional methods for this module which are explained in greater depth <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/process.html" target="_blank">here</a></td>

We could then use the <span class="attribute">.types</span> object appended with the <span class="attribute">.isDate()</span> method to check the truthy or falsey-ness of those variables in the following way;<br/><span class="attribute">console.log(util.types.isDate(dateObject))<br/>console.log(util.types.isDate(string))</span><br/>The result would print true for the date object and false for the string to the terminal.<br/><br/>There are additional methods for this module which are explained in greater depth <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/util.html" target="_blank">here</a></td>

                            <td>The Events module</td>
                            <td>The events module is not a global module and therefore needs to be required in before use.<br/><br/><span class="attribute">const events = require('events');</span><br/><br/>The events module is focused on providing methods that provide functionality on the back end for when there is no set time frame or determined point of them triggering. On the front end we doing this with things like onClick events and the like.<br/><br/>An example of this in action would be if we wanted to trigger a welcome message to someone who just created a new user account with our website.<br/><br/>In our Javascript file (app.js) we <span class="attribute">require</span> in the <span class="attribute">events</span> module at the top and then create a new emitter variable using one of the built in methods in the events module.<br/>It would look like the following;<br/><span class="attribute">let myEmitter = new events.EventEmitter();</span><br/>Notice how we include the keyword <span class="attribute">new</span>, this is because the <span class="attribute">.EventEmitter()</span> method is a <span class="attribute">class</span> which creates new instances when invoked. This means we can make multiple emitters in the same file to listen out for different events.<br/><br/>Because <span class="attribute">.EventEmitter()</span> is a class it means our new variable <span class="attribute">myEmitter</span> also has the methods <span class="attribute">.on()</span> and <span class="attribute">.emit()</span>.<br/>The <span class="attribute">.on()</span> method is the listener portion in a similar way to <span class="attribute">onClick</span>. It takes 2 arguments, the first is the name of the event in string form and the second argument is a listener callback function (This is basically what you want it to do when it hears the event).<br/>The <span class="attribute">.emit()</span> method is the announcement or the 'click' of an onClick event. This also takes 2 arguments. The first is the name of the event in string form so it can match up with the listener, the second argument is essentially the payload, also in string form. This is what will be passed into the listener callback function to be processed.<br/><br/>So in our example we have an emitter (<span class="attribute">myEmitter</span>), lets create a simple callback function the prints a welcome message to the terminal when is is invoked.<br/><span class="attribute">let welcomeNewUser = (data) => {<br/>console.log(`Welcome to the group ${data}!`);<br/>};</span><br/>Then lets create our listener and announcer;<br/><span class="attribute">myEmitter.on('new user', welcomeNewUser);<br/>myEmitter.emit('new user', 'Dave');</span><br/><br/>Now our listener and callback functions are all set up when we run this in node by typing <span class="attribute">node app.js</span> into the terminal we should receive a message back that says 'Welcome to the group Dave!'.<br/><br/>In our example Dave is just a placeholder and would likely be replaced by some sort of user input however for this example it helps to explain the chain of events.<br/>The emitter is invoked with the event name ('new user') and the user input ('Dave'), the listener matches the event ('new user') and fires off the call back function (<span class="attribute">welcomeNewUser</span>) with the payload of 'Dave' from the emitter.<br/>The template literal of <span class="attribute">${data}</span> in the callback function is replaced with the payload of 'Dave' and prints the full message to the terminal.</td>

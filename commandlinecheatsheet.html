It is used as an addition to another command so for example the syntax to change into the above directory would be <span class="code">cd</span> and then <span class="code">..</span> instead of having to write the longhand of the directory name each time you want to move up a level.</td>

This allows for rolling the project back to a previous point if needed.<br/>The commit_SHA section of the syntax is a placeholder.

                            <td>This command allows you to correct mistakes and edit commits instead of creating new ones.<br/><br/>It’s important to note that although it seems like <span class="code">--amend</span> is simply updating the commit, what Git actually does is replace the whole previous commit. For this reason, when you execute the command <span class="code">git commit --amend</span>, your terminal editor asks you to update your commit message. However, if you want to keep the same commit message, you can simply add the flag <span class="code">--no-edit</span><br/>This results in the syntax;<br/><span class="code">git commit --amend --no-edit</span></td>

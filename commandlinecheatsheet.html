For this reason, when you execute the command <span class="code">git commit --amend</span>, your terminal editor asks you to update your commit message. However, if you want to keep the same commit message, you can simply add the flag <span class="code">--no-edit</span><br/>This results in the syntax;<br/><span class="code">git commit --amend --no-edit</span></td>

This, in turn, will ensure it works when we merge it to the master branch upon completion.<br/><br/>We do this by using <span class="code">git fetch</span> to fetch the updated data.<br/>An important point to note here however is that when we use <span class="code">git fetch</span> it will fetch the latest commits of the origin/master branch, our local master branch has not been updated with this data yet.<br/>We can use the command <span class="code">git merge origin/master</span> to update this. Once this has been carried out our local master branch will be up to date with the origin.<br/><br/>Now the local master branch is up to date we follow the below workflow;<br/><br/>1 - Fetch and merge changes from the remote.<br/>2 - Create a branch to work on a new project feature.<br/>3 - Develop the feature on your branch and commit your work.<br/>4 - Fetch and merge from the remote again (in case new commits were made during work on the new feature).<br/>5 - Push the new branch up to the remote for review.<br/><br/>Push is explained later but these steps illustrate, generally, how to collaboratively work on a larger project.</td>

                            <td>Rebasing is an operation possible in Git repo's when the base of a branch needs to be relocated to a new commit point on the masters commit history for some reason. This could be because a bug was found and then fixed or some other changes were made and then merged to the master branch.<br/><br/>Rebasing a branch rewrites its history. It avoids needing to merge back into the master branch and then branching out again into another new feature branch. It keeps a clean history rather than a complicated back and forth.<br/><br/>To rebase a branch, navigate to the branch you want to rebase and then use the command;<br/><br/><span class="code">git rebase main</span><br/><br/>This will rebase the branch and rewrite its history and incoporate any changes that the main branch may have undergone into your local main branch. This can be easily checked by inspecting the files and manually noticing any changes to the code.<br/>You can view the rebased branch by logging the commit history of the branch using the command;<br/><br/><span class="code">git log --graph --decorate --oneline --all</span><br/><br/>This will display tbe rebased branch ahead of the main branch with all its history relocated to be ahead of the main branch.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-rebase" target="_blank">This website explains in greater detail</a></td>

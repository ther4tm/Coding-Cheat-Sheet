                            <td>Core principles</td>
                            <td>Redux is a method of managing state throughout web apps. It is perhaps best thought of as the main HQ for the state in your entire web app.<br/><br/>Before implementing Redux, a React web app can be built from numerous different components, some may have their own states and some may be stateless, however there is no centralised HQ for state.<br/>This is what Redux provides.<br/><br/>In addition to this Redux insists on a system based on a pure separation of concerns when it comes to state. This means that functions that process elements of state should be written to have no additional effect on the input. This ensures that the results are always consistent and the function has no additional logic to change the result other than calculation of its input.<br/>The best analogy for this is that of a cassette player. The player is consistent and will only play the songs present on the inserted cassette.</td>

                        <tr>

                            <td>Importing Redux elements</td>
                            <td>The Redux library must be imported like other methods and components before using in our app. Example syntax is shown below;<br/><br/><span class="attribute">import {  } from 'redux';</span></td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td><span class="attribute">action</span></td>
                            <td>Action keyword</td>
                            <td>In Redux state is managed through actions.<br/><br/>If we follow on with our cassette player analogy, the player itself is a function that we will describe later however, actions are best thought of as different tapes that can be inserted into the player to tell it what song to play.<br/><br/>An action is written as a plain Javacsript object.<br/>Every action has a <span class="attribute">type</span> property with a string value. This string is a description of the action.<br/>Actions can also have a secondary key-value called <span class="attribute">payload</span>. This contains any additional information related to the action.<br/><br/>In the examples below we are interacting with an array that represents the state for a spotify playlist.<br/><br/><span class="attribute">const action = {<br/>type: 'playlist/addSong',<br/>payload: 'Carrion'<br/>};</span><br/><br/>In the above action we are adding a song to the array so our action description is <span class="attribute">'playlist/addSong'</span>. It tells us in very simple terms <span class="attribute">playlist</span> is the state target and <span class="attribute">addSong</span> is the action. It then also tells us what song to add in the <span class="attribute">payload</span>, we are adding a song called <span class="attribute">Carrion</span>.<br/><br/><span class="attribute">const action = {<br/>type: 'playlist/removeSong',<br/>payload: 'Thriller'<br/>}</span><br/><br/>In this action we are removing the song <span class="attribute">Thriller</span> from the playlist<br/><br/><span class="attribute">const action = {<br/>type: 'playlist/removeAll'<br/>}</span><br/><br/>Finally, notice how this action does not have a <span class="attribute">payload</span> because its purpose it to remove everything from the state in contrast to the previous removal action where it is removing a specific item described in the <span class="attribute">payload</span>.</td>

                            <td>Reducer function</td>
                            <td>The reducer function is the cassette player in Redux.<br/><br/>Due to the way i operates and the intentions behind its operation, there are a few additional notes that apply to all reducers that need to be explained before moving on any further.<br/><br/>It is a plain javascript function that defines how the current state and an action are used in combination to create a new state.<br/>It defines the applications next state, given a current state and a specific action.<br/>It returns a default initial state if no action is provided.<br/>It returns the current state if the action is not recognized.<br/><br/>A reducer function accepts 2 arguments these are <span class="attribute">state</span> and <span class="attribute">action</span>.<br/>The rest of the function looks very similar to a <span class="attribute">switch</span> and <span class="attribute">case</span> conditional expression.<br/>The <span class="attribute">state</span> argument is written in an unusual way, although it is an argument it is written as though its a variable declaration.<br/>A couple of different options of how this could be written are shown below to give this some context;<br/><br/><span class="attribute">const someOtherState = [];<br/><br/>const reducer = (state = someOtherState, action) => {<br/>//function body<br/>}</span><br/>OR<br/><span class="attribute">const reducer = (state = [], action) => {<br/>//function body<br/>}</span><br/><br/>The reason for writing the function in this way is that it initialises the state parameter of the function with a default value. So based on the added notes above about how reducer functions work, we need to give the state a default value in the event that the action is not recognized or no action is provided so that a state can, and will, be provided no matter what.<br/>The rest of the function body is written in an almost identical fashion to a <span class="attribute">switch</span> and <span class="attribute">case</span> expression.<br/><br/>An example using the playlist actions from above is shown below, in this example we have declared an initial state called <span class="attribute">playlistState</span> as an array containing 1 item.<br/><br/><span class="attribute">const playlistState = ['Thriller'];<br/><br/>const action = {<br/>type: 'playlist/addSong',<br/>payload: 'Carrion'<br/>}<br/><br/>const action = {<br/>type: 'playlist/removeSong',<br/>payload: 'Thriller'<br/>}<br/><br/>const reducer = (state = playlistState, action) => {<br/>switch (action.type) {<br/>case 'playlist/addSong': {<br/>return [...state, action.payload];<br/>}<br/>case 'playlist/removeSong': {<br/>return state.filter(song => song !== action.payload);<br/>}<br/>}<br/>default: {<br/>return state;<br/>}<br/>};</span><br/><br/>In the above example we establish the state as our <span class="attribute">playlistState</span>. The function body then sets out the cases, in this reducer we use the actions to add a song to the playlist and then remove a song from the playlist.<br/>Once this runs our <span class="attribute">playlistState</span> should have a song called Carrion added and then another one called Thriller removed.</td>

                            <td>The reducer function has some strict requirements to abide by within the Redux framework.<br/><br/>It is required to be immutable and pure.<br/><br/>This means that these functions should only calculate new states based on the arguments put into them and they should not alter the original arguments. They work by copying the state fed into it as an argument and returning the calculated new state, the original stays unaltered.<br/><br/>There should also not be any logic within the function that would randomly modify any of these input parameters nor skew the results in an uncontrolled/unexpected way. They are intended to provide pure and consistent results.<br/>This does not mean that random inputs cannot be put into them as arguments but any value that is processed through the function cannot be calculated within the function in an uncontrolled way.<br/>These functions are also not to be asynchronous. There should be no logging to the console, saving files, setting timers or fetch requests.</td>

                            <td>The Store is a special Redux object that serves as a container for the state.<br/>It is in charge of facilitating the dispatching of actions and triggering reducer functions when actions are dispatched.<br/>In most Redux applications there is typically only one store.<br/><br/>Some important things to note about how the store works with all the other elements explainer are;<br/><br/>1 - The store initialises the state with a default value.<br/>2 - The view displays the state to the user (The view is best thought of as the UI on screen)<br/>3 - When a user interacts with the view, such as clicking a butto, an action is dispatched to the store.<br/>4 - The store's reducer combines the disptached action and the current state to determine the next stte.<br/>5 - The view is updated to display the new state.</td>

This is also the "listener" that is executed in response to changes to the <span class="attribute">state</span>.<br/>A simple example of how this could work is shown below;<br/><br/><span class="attribute">const reactToChange = () => console.log('Change detected!');<br/>store.subscribe(reactToChange);</span><br/><br/>In the above example every time an action is disptached to the <span class="attribute">store</span> and a change to the <span class="attribute">state</span> happens, the function <span class="attribute">reactToChange</span> will be executed.</td>

We can assign this function to a variable like a normal variable to then be able to use this unsubscribe functionality if we wanted to.<br/>The syntax for this is a little confusing in terms of the declaration so an example is given below;<br/><br/><span class="attribute">const unsubscribe = store.subscribe(reactToChange);</span><br/><br/>In the above declaration we have both created the listener using the <span class="attribute">.subscribe()</span> method and in the same declaration we have assigned the returned <span class="attribute">unsubscribe()</span> function to its own variable.<br/><br/>In this example every time our state is updated we print 'Change detected!' to the console as that is the purpose of the <span class="attribute">reactToChange</span> function that is fed into the <span class="attribute">.subscribe()</span> method.<br/>Lets say we have made a number of changes and we no longer want to print to the console we can unsubscribe by calling <span class="attribute">unsubscribe();</span> this will remove the function <span class="attribute">reactToChange</span> from the <span class="attribute">store.subscribe()</span>.<br/><br/>This example is quite simple but if our subscribe function is doing something a bit more interesting or interactive, the ability to stop this and change it to something else could be quite useful.</td>

                            <td>In previous examples of Redux syntax we have been managing state within a single object. There would be various key-value pairings which each could have their own nested key-value pairings containing values, objects and arrays.<br/>An example of a fairly simple state hierarchy with nesting is shown below;<br/><br/><span class="attribute">state = {<br/>todos: [<br/>{<br/>id: 0,<br/>text: 'Complete the Learn Redux course',<br/>isCompleted: false<br/>},<br/>{<br/>id: 1,<br/>text: 'Build a counter app',<br/>isCompleted: true<br/>},<br/>],<br/>visibilityFilter: 'SHOW_INCOMPLETE'<br/>};</span><br/><br/>Redux is good for managing complex states but in order to do this it works on a similar principle to that of components when building Apps in React.<br/>Each different state can be broken down into its own component, separated out, managed and then recombined later on to provide easier management and debugging.<br/><br/>When these states are separated out, each individual one is called a <span class="attribute">slice</span> and typically a <span class="attribute">slice</span> represents a different feature of the app.<br/>With this in mind, our example above shows that we potentially have 2 different slices contained within our <span class="attribute">state</span> object;<br/>We have the <span class="attribute">todos</span> array that contains 2 separate objects.<br/>We also have the <span class="attribute">visibilityFilter</span> which is a string value.</td>

                            <td>When separating out slices it is best practice to establish an initial state for each slice. Each slice will have its own reducer and as such the reducer will need a default state to use when being updated.</td>

                            <td>When an application state has multiple slices, individual actions typically only change one slice at a time. Therefore, it is recommended that each action’s <span class="attribute">type</span> follows the pattern <span class="attribute">'sliceName/actionDescriptor'</span>, to clarify which slice of state should be updated.<br/><br/>An example of this is shown below;<br/><br/><span class="attribute">export const setSearchTerm = (term) => {<br/>return {<br/>type: 'searchTerm/setSearchTerm',<br/>payload: term<br/>};<br/>}<br/><br/>export const loadData = () => {<br/>return {<br/>type: 'allRecipes/loadData',<br/>payload: allRecipesData<br/>}<br/>}</span><br/><br/>In the above examples we have 2 different action creator functions that are dispatching actions to separate slices. Notice how each action <span class="attribute">type</span> follows the naming convention of what slice it is for and then what the action is doing.</td>

                            <td>In complex Apps that require numerous different states, all the states created for the App are seperate individual slices. These are then managed by their own reducer functions to provide updates to each individual state.<br/><br/>So for example if we use the 2 actions above as a guide we can see that we have 2 seperate slices (<span class="attribute">searchTerm</span> & <span class="attribute">allRecipes</span>) due to Redux naming conventions.<br/><br/>In complex Apps with a number of states each state may be seperated out into individual files (much like components in React) and then imported back into the Store file later one.<br/>Within each of those files we would need to have a separate reducer function that manages that particular state.<br/>So using <span class="attribute">searchTerm</span> as an example we might have a file called <span class="code">searchTermSlice.js</span> and in that file we could have the following;<br/><br/><span class="attribute">const initialSearchTerm = '';<br/><br/>export const searchTermReducer = (searchTerm = initialSearchTerm, action) => {<br/>switch(action.type) {<br/>case 'searchTerm/setSearchTerm':<br/>return action.payload;<br/>case 'searchTerm/clearSearchTerm':<br/>return '';<br/>default:<br/>return searchTerm;<br/>}<br/>}</span><br/><br/>So in the example above we have an <span class="attribute">initialState</span> defined to give our reducer function a default state. Then we have a reducer function that handles the logic for updating/amending the state.<br/><br/>This convention provides a greater level of clarity to code readability and simplicity when debugging specifically concerning state because we know that we only have 1 state to worry about in this instance and when we encounter bugs we can deal with them individually.</td>

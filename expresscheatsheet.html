                            <td>Express is a node module.<br/>It does not come pre-installed so we need to install it before use. We can do this using <span class="attribute">npm</span> in the terminal.<br/><br/>The correct syntax for this is shown below;<br/><br/><span class="attribute">npm i express</span><br/><br/>Once installed into the project file we can then require it in like any other non-global node module.<br/><br/><span class="attribute">const express = require('express');</span><br/><br/>Once required in we then need to invoke the express method within a variable to then be able to create a server.<br/><br/><span class="attribute">const app = express();</span><br/><br/>With that all now established we can start a server and specify server behavior.</td>

                            <td>The purpose of a server is to listen for requests, perform whatever action is required to satisfy the request, and then return a response.<br/><br/>In order for our server to start responding, we have to tell the server where to listen for new requests by providing a port number argument to a method called <span class="attribute">app.listen()</span>.<br/>The server will then listen on the specified port and respond to any requests that come into it.<br/>The second argument is a callback function that will be called once the server is running and ready to receive responses.<br/><br/>An example of syntax is shown below;<br/><br/><span class="attribute">const app = express();<br/>const PORT = 4001;<br/><br/>app.listen(PORT, () => {<br/>console.log(`Server is listening on port ${PORT}`);<br/>});</span><br/><br/>In the above example we create a <span class="attribute">PORT</span> variable that contains the port number for our server to listen for instructions on. We then invoke the <span class="attribute">.listen()</span> express method, providing the <span class="attribute">PORT</span> variable as the first argument and a callback function that prints a simple message to the console as the second argument.</td>

                            <td>Once we have set up the server to listen for any and all requests we then need to establish how it will respond to these requests.<br/>This requires us to create a number of Routes.<br/>Routes in this context are basically like instructions in a similar vein to actions in Redux.<br/><br/>Routes define the control flow for specific requests based on the request's included path and HTTP verb.<br/><br/>So for example, a user on the front end might click a link to look at another page of the website.<br/>This is a get request.<br/>The link clicked by the user triggers a get request to be sent to the back end. The details of how this works will be explained later but our site will have some routes set up to provide appropriate responses to these requests, instructions on what the back end should do next and how it should respond.<br/><br/>There will be many different routes set up to enable different functionality.<br/>They are defined by the specific HTTP verb (GET, POST etc.) and paths.<br/>The path is the part of a request URL after the hostname and port number, so in a request to <span class="code">localhost:4001/monsters</span>, the hostname is <span class="code">localhost</span>, the port the server is listening on is <span class="code">4001</span> and the path is <span class="code">/monsters</span></td>

Express will match this route and call the callback function.<br/>In the response body it shows that the route has been set up to use the <span class="attribute">.send()</span> method on the response object with the argument <span class="attribute">monsters</span>.<br/>Above this route you can see the <span class="attribute">monsters</span> variable contains an array of objects containing various <span class="attribute">key:value</span> pairs of different monsters.<br/><br/>All of this will be sent back as the response because this is what the route has been set up to do.</td>

Both have a few built in methods that provide tools to deal with requests and responses. The most important thing to keep in mind here is that both are objects containing information about the incoming request and its associated information (<span class="attribute">req</span>) or the outgoing response and its details (<span class="attribute">res</span>).</td>

                            <td>Dynamic routes</td>
                            <td>Dynamic routes in express.js are called route parameters. They can be easily identified through the use of the <span class="attribute">:</span> character at the beginning of the path segment.<br/><br/>They work in a very similar way to DOM routing in React, in that you can define a route with a placeholder that allows for the dynamic interaction of unknown content.<br/>For example, if we created a route path of <span class="code">/monsters/:name</span> then both the incoming GET requests of <span class="code">/monsters/hydra</span> and <span class="code">/monsters/dragon</span> would be valid and get matched to our dynamic route.<br/><br/>The next interesting point to note about this is that express extracts the values of those parameters and attaches them as an object to the request object under the key <span class="attribute">req.params</span>.<br/>Within this object it then creates a key:value pair with the key being the dynamic route placeholder and the value being whatever information is extracted from the request.<br/><br/>So for example the GET request of <span class="code">/monsters/hydra</span> would be accepted as a valid request, the <span class="code">hydra</span> part of the path would be extracted and could then be accessed through the <span class="attribute">req</span> object at <span class="attribute">req.params.name</span>.<br/><br/>Below is a visual explanation of the <span class="attribute">req</span> object to show how the dynamic route has extracted and stored the information for use in a response.<br/><br/><span class="attribute">req = {<br/>//example other key,<br/>params: {<br/>{ name: hydra }<br/>},<br/>//example other key<br/>}</span><br/><br/>For a practical example lets say that we have a database on the back end of monster stats. The front end is our website that is displaying various facts about monsters, the user can click different links to load up the different stats.<br/>Whenever the user clicks the link it will send a GET request for each different monster. Each different monster will send its own GET request including its own path. We can use dynamic routing to accept all of these and send back the relevant stats for display on the website.<br/><br/><span class="attribute">const monsters = { <br/>hydra: { height: 3, age: 4 },<br/>dragon: { height: 200, age: 350 } <br/>};<br/><br/>app.get('/monsters/:name', (req, res, next) => {<br/>console.log(req.params); // { name: 'hydra' }<br/>res.send(monsters[req.params.name.height]);<br/>});</span><br/><br/>As you can see above, we have our database of monster facts and underneath we have our dynamic route that accepts the dynamic input of <span class="code">:name</span>.<br/>When the user clicks on <span class="attribute">hydra</span> this will trigger a GET request that will send the path <span class="code">/monsters/hydra</span> to our express server. Our dynamic route will accept this, because it follows the valid pattern we've written in the GET request and as you can see in the response we use the extracted values from <span class="attribute">req.params</span> to access the relevant information from our <span class="attribute">monsters</span> database and we send our <span class="attribute">res</span> object back pinpointing (in this example) the height value of the hydra in our <span class="attribute">monsters</span> database.</td>

                            <td>Longer dynamic routes</td>
                            <td>Route parameters match to their specific part of the path. What this means is that the dynamic portion of the route can be much further along the path than the first section after the root, all you need to bear in mind is that the route should mirror this in order for a request to be successful.<br/><br/>An example of correct syntax is shown below;<br/><br/><span class="code">Request = GET /monster/name/25</span><br/><br/><span class="attribute">app.get('/monster/name')<br/><br/>app.get('/monster/name/:id')</span><br/><br/>In the above example the request would get checked against the first route (because this is how express works, top to bottom), it would fail because the route path isn't the correct length.<br/>It would then move onto the next route, check the path and match because it is of the correct length and it is dynamic meaning that our request would match.</td>

                            <td>Express has a built in method that allows us to set status codes on any response that we send back. Status codes are automatically sent back on successful (200 OK) or unsuccessful (404 NOT FOUND) responses, however we can include a status method and provide a custom status code.<br/><br/><span class="attribute">const monsterStoreInventory = { fenrirs: 4, banshees: 1, jerseyDevils: 4, krakens: 3 };<br/><br/>app.get('/monsters-inventory/:name', (req, res, next) => {<br/>const monsterInventory = monsterStoreInventory[req.params.name];<br/>if (monsterInventory) {<br/>res.send(monsterInventory);<br/>} else {<br/>res.status(404).send('Monster not found');<br/>}<br/>});</span><br/><br/>In the example above we've set up a route to check an inventory database. If the request finds something, it send back a response with an automatic 200 OK response code.<br/>If the request is for something not contained within the database we send back a 404 code with our custom message 'Monster not found' chained onto the end of the <span class="attribute">.status()</span> method.</td>

                            <td>Using Queries</td>
                            <td>Query strings appear at the end of the path in URLs and they are indicated with a <span class="attribute">?</span> character.<br/><br/>Query strings do not count as part of the path.<br/><br/>Therefore a request of <span class="code">/monsters/1?name=chimera&age=1</span> can be broken down into the path, which would be <span class="code">/monsters/1</span> and the query which would be <span class="code">name=chimera&age=1</span><br/><br/>Express parses anything after the <span class="attribute">?</span> into a Javascript object that is then automatically attached to the request object as the value of <span class="attribute">req.query</span>.<br/><br/>They key:value relationship of the query string is indicated by the <span class="attribute">=</span> character contained in the query string. Furthermore key:value pairs are further separated by the <span class="attribute">&</span> character.<br/>So in our example above, the object automatically attached to <span class="attribute">req.query</span> would look like;<br/><br/><span class="attribute">{ name: chimera, age: 1 }</span></td>

                            <td>PUT requests are used for updating existing resources. Like a user's location or their favourite food within their user profile.<br/><br/>Below is an example of how we can use PUT requests to allow a user to update the details of our monsters.<br/><br/>Let's say that our user decides to change the name and age of the monster at index 1 in our database. The PUT request would look like this;<br/><span class="attribute">/monsters/1?name=chimera&age=1</span><br/><br/>To make this change our code would look like the below;<br/><br/><span class="attribute">const monsters = {<br/>'1': { name: 'cerberus', age: '4'  }<br/>'2': { name: 'dragon', age: '67'  }<br/>};<br/><br/>app.put('/monsters/:id', (req, res, next) => {<br/>const monsterUpdates = req.query;<br/>monsters[req.params.id] = monsterUpdates;<br/>res.send(monsters[req.params.id]);<br/>});</span><br/><br/>At the top we have our existing monster database. It is an object that contains various monsters arranged by ID. The ID's are numbered and within each ID is another object that contains the monster's name and its age.<br/>As with any Javascript object, all of these details can be easily accessed through standard dot notation<br/>(e.g. <span class="attribute">monsters['1'].name</span> would get 'cerberus').<br/><br/>Underneath this we have our route to handle the PUT request.<br/>The path is dynamic which allows us to handle any particular monster selected by the user based on its ID.<br/>Within the callback we have a variable (<span class="attribute">monsterUpdates</span>) set up to extract the query information (<span class="attribute">req.query</span>) received from the request object.<br/>which is <span class="attribute">{ name:'chimera', age: '1'}</span><br/><br/>Underneath this we have the section of code that does the actual update.<br/>It says in the <span class="attribute">monsters</span> variable (our database) we target a specific monster using the <span class="attribute">[req.params.id]</span>. The ID is <span class="code">1</span> because that's the ID contained within the path from request, so this is targetting the object with the key of <span class="code">'1'</span> in the <span class="attribute">monsters</span> object (our database of monsters).<br/>Currently that monster is <span class="attribute">{ name: 'cerberus', age: '4' }</span>.<br/>In our code we are then re-assigning this to be the information we have received from the PUT request and stored in the <span class="attribute">monsterUpdates</span> variable.<br/>Now we know Javascript objects recognise the same keys if they already exist and simply overwrites the values and if the key doesn't exist it will create it for us.<br/>In this example the keys already exist so this piece of code will overwrite<br/><span class="attribute">{ name: 'cerberus', age: '4' }</span><br/>with the value in our PUT request which we know is<br/><span class="attribute">{ name: 'chimera', age: '1' }</span>.<br/><br/>The final part of the code is a simple <span class="attribute">.send()</span> method that sends this back to the front end. This is best thought of as a confirmation that the change has been made and displays this to the front end.</td>

                            <td>POST requests are slightly different from GET and PUT requests because a POST request is creating new information as opposed to retrieving or editing existing information.<br/><br/>This is an important factor to bear in mind when it comes to adding the information to an existing database. If we are adding new information to an array we can simply add this to the array using various array editing methods like <span class="attribute">.push()</span> however, if we are editing an object it becomes a little more tricky as we are likely to want to give it a key based on either an index or something unique to prevent clashes of information.<br/><br/>An example of this is shown below;<br/><br/>Lets say we want to add a brand new monster to our existing monster database.<br/>It currently looks like the below;<br/><br/><span class="attribute">const monsters = {<br/>'1': { name: 'chimera', age: '1' }<br/>'2': { name: 'dragon', age: '67' }<br/>};</span><br/><br/>Our monsters are arranged within the database using indexes (<span class="attribute">'1'</span>) as the key for each individual monster and the associated records. When we add a new one we need to take this into account in how we handle the request.<br/><br/><span class="attribute">app.post('/monsters', (req, res, next) => {<br/>const newMonster = req.query;<br/>if (newMonster) {<br/>monsters[Object.keys(monsters).length] = newMonster;<br/>res.status(201).send(newMonster);<br/>} else {<br/>res.status(400).send()<br/>}<br/>});</span><br/><br/>Each individual case will handle this differently however in this small example this is how we would use the POST request to add new content to our existing monsters database.<br/>Notice how we also add in a quick sense checking <span class="attribute">if</span> statement that ensures we have valid content and sends back a 201 content created status code if successful or a 400 not valid code if unsuccessful.<br/><br/>So if our POST request looked like this;<br/><span class="code">/monsters?name=cerberus&age=4</span><br/><br/>Then our new database would end up looking like the below;<br/><br/><span class="attribute">const monsters = {<br/>'1': { name: 'chimera', age: '1' },<br/>'2': { name: 'dragon', age: '67' },<br/>'3': { name: 'cerberus', age: '4' }<br/>};</span></td>

                            <td>DELETE Method</td>
                            <td>DELETE requests are used to delete existing data, because these routes are used to delete existing data their paths should usually end with a route parameter to indicate which resource to delete.<br/><br/>As with the POST request, deleting elements from an array can be done with the available array editing methods such as <span class="attribute">.splice()</span> however some thought into how to target the specific item to be deleted should be given when forming the route.<br/><br/>An example of how to delete an entry from our monsters database is shown below;<br/><br/>Lets say our database is as shown below;<br/><br/><span class="attribute">const monsters = {<br/>'1': { name: 'chimera', age: '1' },<br/>'2': { name: 'dragon', age: '67' },<br/>'3': { name: 'cerberus', age: '4' }<br/>};</span><br/><br/>And we receive a DELETE request as follows;<br/><span class="code">/monsters/1</span><br/><br/>Our route might look something like the following;<br/><br/><span class="attribute">app.delete('/monsters/:id', (req, res, next) => {<br/>const id = req.params.id;<br/><br/>if (monsters.hasOwnProperty(id)) {<br/>delete monsters[id];<br/>res.status(204).send('Monster deleted');<br/>} else {<br/>res.status(404).send('Monster not found');<br/>}<br/>});</span><br/><br/>Notice how we have a dynamic route set up to accept any input to delete a monster from the database.<br/>We extract the ID parameter from the request path and then use that to identify which element of our database we intend to delete. A 204 No content code is sent upon successful deletion.<br/>One important point to note here is that when we delete this entry from our database, the existing entries do not get refactored, therefore our database will now look like the following;<br/><br/><span class="attribute">const monsters = {<br/>'2': { name: 'dragon', age: '67' },<br/>'3': { name: 'cerberus', age: '4' }<br/>};</span><br/><br/>As a result the database object might look a little messy and could potentially be difficult to maintain with numbered keys like this example.</td>

It consists of standards and constraints for sharing data between different systems.<br/>Systems that implement this architecture are known as RESTful.<br/><br/>A simple way of visualising what REST is would be to compare it to physical collections of music, movies or TV programmes against a streaming service.<br/>If you want to listen to a specific track, the entire album must be copied and duplicated and then distributed however with a streaming service a singular track can be shared via a reference to a song title and doesn't require a copy of the entire album to be made. The streaming service is RESTful whereas the physical collection is not.<br/><br/>An Application Programming Interface (API) is an interface that allows software programmes to communicate with one another. A RESTful API is the same but it is constrained by the principles of REST.<br/>In a web API a server receives a request through a URL endpoint and sends a response in return which is often data in JSON format.</td>

It operates on the boundary, so to speak, between those two HTTP actions.<br/><br/>In Express, middleware is a function. (<span class="attribute">app.use()</span> or <span class="attribute">app.get()</span> etc...)<br/>Middleware can perform logic on the request and response objects, such as: inspecting a request, performing some logic based on the request, attaching information to the response, attaching a status to the response, sending the response back to the user, or simply passing the request and response to another middleware. Middleware can do any combination of those things or anything else a Javascript function can do.<br/><br/>Most of Express's functionality lies around chaining middleware together. The chain of middleware is called the middleware stack.<br/><br/>The middleware stack is processed in the order that each middleware appears in the application file.<br/>This happens regardless of method so if an <span class="attribute">app.get()</span> is the first thing in the application followed by an <span class="attribute">app.use()</span> then the get method will still get called first.</td>

Checking against usernames, passwords, whether submitted information is formatted correctly or even orf the correct type.<br/><br/>Following the the principles of DRY coding we can write a middleware that does this for us, and even more importantly we can write route specific versions of this.<br/><br/>Lets say we have an application that has multiple endpoints, each one providing different functionality to our website.<br/>Things like <span class="code">/jellyBean</span>, <span class="code">/lollipop</span>, <span class="code">/iceCream</span> etc...<br/>Lets also say that we have various routes defined in our application on the <span class="code">/jellyBean</span> route.<br/><br/>On those routes we want to provide targetted checking logic. This is to make sure that whatever <span class="code">/jellyBean</span> requests come in, look for valid information held in our database.<br/>To do this we can create a middleware that only targets this endpoint for whatever GET, PUT, POST or DELETE request might come in .<br/>This will serve as the first stop in the middleware chain to provide the check to ensure the request is valid before spending any further processing power on the request.<br/>It will also allow us to take all of this additional checking logic out that previously would be held in each individual callback functions of the various GET, PUT, POST and DELETE routes.<br/><br/><span class="attribute">app.use('/jellyBean', (req, res, next) => {<br/>const productName = req.params.productName;<br/>if (!productDatabase[productName]) {<br/>console.log('Response Sent');<br/>return res.status(404).send('Product with that name does not exist');<br/>}<br/><br/>next();<br/>});</span><br/><br/>The code above invokes the <span class="attribute">.use()</span> method and mounts it on the <span class="code">/jellyBean</span> path endpoint. This means any request that comes in on that path will first be run through the middleware to check the request is valid.<br/>The checking logic here is not important as its just a generic logic to demonstrate the point however within the checking logic notice how there is a <span class="attribute">return</span> on the <span class="attribute">if</span> statement.<br/>This is important as it provides a break point for the code if the request fails the checking logic. It stops the code from running any further and provides a 404 failure code back to the front end.<br/><br/>Notice also how at the end of the callback functions body is a <span class="attribute">next()</span> call.

This provides us with a sense check on the request before progressing any further.<br/>So, for example, if the requested item does not exist we can quickly return an error indicating that the item doesn't exist before processing any further code.<br/><br/>Having this sense checking logic inevitably ends up in the same sense checking logic being written multiple times as the app grows in complexity and more middlewares are required to do various tasks.<br/>The <span class="attribute">.param()</span> method allows us to write a middleware that provides a sense check once and simplify the rest of the middlewares into doing what we actually want them to do, thereby using DRY coding principles and simplifying the code.<br/><br/>An An example is shown below;<br/><br/>Lets say that we have our database of jellybeans and then on our backend we have multiple middlewares that provide GET, PUT, POST and DELETE functionality.<br/>Each one of those middlewares will have an endpoint that looks like the following;<br/><span class="code">/jellyBean/:jellyBeanId</span><br/><br/>As mentioned above, because we don't know what the user request will be, we will need to provide checking logic against each of these endpoints for the <span class="code">:jellyBeanId</span> parameter to ensure the request is valid.<br/>This means the same logic will need to be written 4 times, once for each of the middlewares.<br/>The logic for the GET request might look something like the below;<br/><br/><span class="attribute">app.get('/jellyBean/:jellyBeanId', (req, res, next) => {<br/>const params = req.params.jellyBeanId;<br/>const jellyBeanId = jellyBeanDatabase.findIndex(jellyBean => jellyBean.id === params;);<br/>if (jellyBeanId !== -1) {<br/>res.send(jellyBeanDatabase[params]);<br/>} else {<br/>res.status(404).send('JellyBean Not Found');<br/>});</span><br/><br/>However we can avoid this by using the <span class="attribute">.param()</span> method and creating a new middleware that is ordered to trigger before any of these other middlewares.<br/>Our <span class="attribute">.param()</span> method should be placed above any of the routes, so it triggers first, and then in this case it might look something like the below;<br/><br/><span class="attribute">app.param('jellyBeanId', (req, res, next, id) => {<br/>const jellyBeanId = Number(id);<br/>const found = jellyBeanDatabase.findIndex(jellyBean => jellyBean.id === jellyBeanId);<br/>if (found !== -1) {<br/>req.jellyBeanIndex = found;<br/>next();<br/>} else {<br/>res.sendStatus(404);<br/>}<br/>})</span><br/><br/>There are a few things to note here, the first is that the route handler doesn't contain a <span class="attribute">:</span> before the parameter, it's just <span class="attribute">jellyBeanId</span>. The parameter is passed into the callback function, which now has 4 arguments. The last one being that parameter.<br/>Within our logic we do a quick check to make sure its a number and then store that parameter in a variable.<br/>This is then used in a <span class="attribute">.findIndex()</span> method to check our database to see if an entry that matches that index exists, if it does then that number is stored in the variable <span class="attribute">found</span>.<br/>After this we have a simple <span class="attribute">if...else</span> statement that attaches that index number to the <span class="attribute">req</span> object under <span class="attribute">jellyBeanIndex</span> for future use in other middlewares, or if the logic fails we send back an error status code.<br/><br/>With this no in place we can refactor all of our GET, PUT, POST and DELETE requests to remove any checking logic as the <span class="attribute">.param()</span> middleware will do it first before passing it on to the relevant route handlers.<br/>So for example our GET route from earlier might be refactored to look like the below;<br/><br/><span class="attribute">app.get('jellyBean/:jellyBeanId', (req, res, next) => {<br/>res.send(jellyBeanDatabase[req.jellyBeanIndex]);<br/>});</span><br/><br/>Notice how much simpler the route becomes. Also notice how we now use the new request object parameter of <span class="attribute">.jellyBeanIndex</span> to send back the relevant information as we have already done the check and created this parameter in the <span class="attribute">.param()</span> middleware.</td>

The longer and more complex they are, the more difficult it is for a hacker to gain access.<br/>They are ideally over 128 bits long and do not contain any kind of personal information to reduce the possibility of guessing.<br/>Any kind of algorithm should also not follow any kind of predictable pattern which would aid hacking.<br/><br/><span class="code">Securing Cookies</span><br/>If cookies are to be used then they should be secured with the keywords already discussed.

We use this within the anonymous function body to simply pass either errors or authenticated users to <span class="attribute">passport</span>. Under the hood it is best thought of as a simple function that passes information on.<br/>It is a method so it accepts 2 arguments, 1 - An error or null if no error is found, 2 - A user or false if no user is found.<br/>The <span class="attribute">username</span>, and <span class="attribute">password</span> parameters are the user input received when a user tries to log in.<br/><br/>So lets look at what the anonymous function body should be doing to authenticate a user.<br/>We want it to;<br/><br/>1 - Do a check on our database that the provided username exists.<br/>2 - If the username does not exist we want to produce an error and bounce it back.<br/>3 - If the username does exist then we want to do a check to see if the provided password is valid.<br/>4 - If the password is not valid then we want to produce an error and bounce it back.<br/>5 - If the username and password are both valid then we want to return the user object.<br/><br/>Below we have an example of a strategy.<br/>In this strategy we have a lookup function (<span class="attribute">.findByUsername()</span>), this is just a demonstration function and could behave differently however for the purpose of this example it looks up the username in the database and then returns either an error or a user object.<br/>The returned items are fed into a callback function which is where our authentication logic is located.<br/><br/><span class="attribute">passport.use(new LocalStrategy(<br/>function (username, password, done) {<br/></span><span class="code"><br/>//The below code targets our database and uses the checking method on the users key in the database</span><br/><span class="attribute">database.users.findByUsername(username, (err, user) => {<br/></span><span class="code"><br/>//If there's an error in db lookup return err in callback function</span><br/><span class="attribute">if (err) return done(err);</span><br/><span class="code"><br/>//If user is not found, return null and false in callback function</span><br/><span class="attribute">if (!user) return done(null, false);</span><br/><span class="code"><br/>//If user is found but password is invalid, return err and false in callback function</span><br/><span class="attribute">if (user.password != password) return done(null, false);</span><br/><span class="code"><br/>//If user is found and the password is valid, return the user object in the callback function</span><br/><span class="attribute">return done(null, user);<br/>});<br/>})<br/>);</span><br/><br/>Notice in the above logic we follow an error first approach, so as soon as a negative result is encountered we break out of the code.<br/>The checking logic systematically checks through each our points and if successful authenticates the user.<br/>This creates a session and is maintained via a cookie set in the user's browser.</td>

Whenever a user log's in in the future we can run their input through tha same hashing function and as long as they enter the correct password, the hash output will match the hash output they made during signup that we store in our database and they will be authenticated.<br/><br/>This also provides security to the users if our database were to be hacked.

So, commonly used passwords may have already been run through a hashing function and the hash output is likely to exist on a rainbow table.<br/>So if our database were to be hacked and someone got hold of the stored hash functions, they could then compare these to the values in the rainbow tables. If the password has already been computed then the hackers could easily figure out the original password.<br/><br/>This is why when creating a password it is often good practice to use complex combinations as these values are not likely to have been precomputed and therefore will not be on any rainbow tables.<br/><br/>As web developers we cannot rely on users always following this advice and therefore we can implement the use of salts.<br/><br/>Salts are basically extra little values added onto a user's password before it is hashed.<br/>By adding additional values to the user's password it completely changes the output from the hashing algorithm, meaning that even if they choose to use a common password, the output of the hashing algorithm will be completely different from that same commonly used password's hash output found on any rainbow table.<br/><br/>So for example if our password is <span class="code">p@ssw0rd</span>, when we hash this we might end up with an output that looks like the following;<br/><span class="code">0f359740bd1cda994f8b55330c86d845</span><br/><br/>However if we use salts then our password combo of <span class="code">p@ssw0rd</span> + <span class="code">salts</span> when hashed will produce a completely different value that might look like the following;<br/><span class="code">91ef19df6bc9c88c5d99c9584797adee</span><br/><br/>As you can see, the hash outputs are completely different and even though we are using a common password, the use of salts provides our users with added protection against the use of rainbow tables.</td>

                            <td>OAuth is an authorization framework.<br/><br/>It basically allows a server to access authenticated resources from another server without sharing passwords.<br/>This works by allowing applications to authenticate with 3rd party services in exchange for an access token which is passed with a HTTP request to access protected content.<br/><br/>The most familiar versions of this will be when you go to a website and it says 'Sign in with Facebook' or 'Sign in with Google'.<br/>This process is using the 3rd party of Facebook or Google to authenticate the user.<br/><br/>So how does it authenticate?<br/><br/>Lets say a user is accessing our website and they sign in with Facebook. Our website will redirect them to a Facebook sign in page, they will sign into Facebook with their Facebook username and password.<br/>Facebook will authenticate them and then make sure that user is happy with the permissions our website is asking for.<br/><br/>There will be no exchange of passwords. The Facebook password will remain a secret between the user and Facebook.<br/><br/>Once the user agrees to giving the relevant permissions, they will be redirected back to our website and Facebook will provide our website with an access token.<br/>Whenever we might want to access information about the user, like a birth date for example, our website will send a request back to Facebook for this information as well as the access token.<br/><br/>The access token is basically like a key card saying that we have the right credentials to access that information.<br/>Facebook will validate the access token and upon validation will send back the requested information.</td>

For this exchange to take place, you have to also pass along your app’s Client Secret. The secret must be securely stored on the client side. The implicit flow is suitable for applications that access APIs and cannot store sensitive information.<br/><br/>How this OAuth flow works:<br/><br/>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>The user clicks on a login link in the web application.</li>
                                    <li>The user is redirected to an OAuth authorization server, after which an OAuth login prompt is issued.</li>
                                    <li>The user provides credentials according to the enabled login options.</li>
                                    <li>Typically, the user is shown a list of permissions that will be granted to the web application by logging in and granting consent.</li>
                                    <li>The user is redirected to the application, with the authorization server providing a one-time authorization code.</li>
                                    <li>The app receives the user’s authorization code and forwards it along with the Client ID and Client Secret, to the OAuth authorization server.</li>
                                    <li>The authorization server generates an ID Token, Access Token, and an optional Refresh Token, before providing them them to the app.</li>
                                    <li>The web application can then use the Access Token to gain access to the target API with the user’s credentials.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <br/>Use Cases: Server side web applications where the source code is not exposed publicly.<br/><br/>
                                <span class="code">Client Credentials Flow</span><br/>The Client Credentials Flow allows applications to pass their Client Secret and Client ID to an authorization server, which authenticates the user, and returns a token. This happens without any user intervention.<br/><br/>How this OAuth flow works:<br/><br/>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>The application authenticates with the OAuth authorization server, passing the Client Secret and Client ID.</li>
                                    <li>The authorization server checks the Client Secret and Client ID and returns an Access Token to the application.</li>
                                    <li>The Access Token allows the application to access the target API with the required user account.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <br/>Use Cases: M2M apps (daemons, back-end services, and CLIs). In these types of apps, the system authenticates and grants permission behind the scenes without involving the user, because the “user” is often a machine or service role. It doesn’t make sense to show a login prompt or use social logins.<br/><br/>
                                <span class="code">Resource Owner Password Flow</span><br/>The Resource Owner Password Flow asks users to submit their credentials via a form. Credentials are transferred to the backend and may be retained for future use, before an Access Token is granted. It’s essential that the app is completely trusted. Therefore, this flow is generally not recommended.<br/><br/>How this OAuth flow works:<br/><br/>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>The user clicks a login link in the application and enters credentials into a form managed by the app.</li>
                                    <li>The application stores the credentials, and passes them to the OAuth authorization server.</li>
                                    <li>The authorization server validates credentials and returns the Access Token (and an optional Refresh Token).</li>
                                    <li>The app can now access the target API with the user’s credentials.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <br/>Use Cases:  Highly-trusted applications, where other flows based on redirects cannot be used.<br/><br/>
                                <span class="code">Implicit Flow with Form Post</span><br/>This flow uses OIDC to implement a web sign-in that functions like WS-Federation and SAML. The web app requests and receives tokens via the front channel, without requiring extra backend calls or secrets. With this process, you don’t have to use, maintain, obtain or safeguard secrets in your app.<br/><br/>Use Cases: Apps that don't want to maintain secrets locally.<br/><br/>
                                <span class="code">Hybrid Flow</span><br/>This flow can benefit apps that can securely retain Client Secrets. It lets your app obtain immediate access to an ID token, while enabling ongoing retrieval of additional access and refresh tokens. This is useful for apps that need to immediately gain access to data about the user, but must perform some processing prior to gaining access to protected resources for a long time.<br/><br/>Use Cases: Apps that need immediate access to data about the user, but also need to use this data on an ongoing basis.<br/><br/>
                                <span class="code">Device Authorization Flow</span><br/>This flow makes it possible to authenticate users without asking for their credentials. This provides a better user experience for mobile devices, where it may be more difficult to type credentials. Applications on these devices can transfer their Client ID to the Device Authorization Flow to start the authorization process and obtain a token.<br/><br/>Use Cases: Apps running on input-constrained devices that are online (Things like Smart TV's), enabling seamless authentication via credentials stored on the device.<br/><br/>
                                <span class="code">Authorization Code Flow with PKCE</span><br/>This flow uses a PKCE. A secret known as a Code Verifier is provided by the calling application, which may be verified by the authorization server using a Proof Key. <br/><br/>Use Cases: Apps that need to serve unknown public clients who may introduce additional security issues that are not addressed by the Auth Code Flow.<br/><br/>All the above info can be found on the original website <a href="https://frontegg.com/blog/oauth-flows" target="_blank">here</a></td>

In purely machine authorization, the Client is the same as the Resource Owner, so the end-user doesn’t need to provide any additional authorization. In this case, use Client Credentials Flow.<br/><br/><span class="code">Is the Client a Web App Executing on the Server?</span><br/>When the Client is a typical web app executive via a server, you should apply the Authorization Code Flow. It provides an Access Token (and an optional Refresh Token) directly to the Client. This is a safer approach than having the Access Token pass through the user’s web browser, which may lead to exposure.<br/><br/><span class="code">Is the Client Completely Trusted with User Credentials?</span><br/>If the Client is trusted, the system may generate a Resource Owner Password Credential Grant. In this scenario, the end-user must provide credentials (passwords and usernames), generally via a digital form. The data is then passed on to the backend. It is essential that the Client is completely trusted. <br/><br/>This grant must only be employed when a redirect-based flow (Auth Code Flow) is not viable. For such cases, use the Resource Owner Password Flow.<br/><br/><span class="code">Is the Client a Single-Page Application?</span><br/>A Single-Page Application (SPA) is a browser-based one that employs scripting languages like JavaScript. When the Client is a Single-Page Application, you can use one of two grant options—the Implicit Flow with Form Post and the Authorization Code Flow with PKCE.<br/><br/>The preferred option is usually the Authorization Code Flow with PKCE as the client-side Access Token. It is not exposed and can deliver Refresh Tokens.<br/><br/><span class="code">Is the Client a Native Mobile Application?</span><br/>When using native applications, you should probably opt for the PKCE (Proof Code for Code Exchange) Authorization Code Flow.<br/><br/>All the above info can be found on the original website <a href="https://frontegg.com/blog/oauth-flows" target="_blank">here</a></td>

                            <td>What is Headless testing?<br/>Headless testing is basically the testing of websites and apps without the GUI of a browser.<br/>It's quicker to execute because the time needed to process the GUI is no longer included.<br/><br/>Within the test you can still generate screenshots and PDFs of websites, scrape content from websites, automate form submission, and simulate keyboard input.<br/><br/><a href="https://expressjs.com/en/5x/api.html" target="_blank">LogRocket.com has a brief overview of various headless testing methods here</a></td>

                            <td>Feature tests can simulate user navigation. We can test to see if certain aspects of our app are behaving as expected using this.<br/><br/>So for example if we wish to create an app that had a messaging aspect to it and we want to test that the message area was blank upon a user navigating there at the beginning of a session, we could test for that.<br/><br/><span class="attribute">describe('User visits root', () => {<br/>describe('without existing messages', () => {<br/>it('starts blank', ()  => {<br/>browser.url('/');<br/>})<br/>});<br/>});</span><br/><br/>In the above code we have a basic mocha test block with some nested <span class="attribute">describe()</span> methods and an <span class="attribute">it()</span> method that form the basis of the test.<br/>Within the block we make use of the global <span class="attribute">browser</span> variable that is provided by WebdriverI/O.<br/>The browser variable gives us access to the headless browser we are running in the background. With this we can simulate interactions with the website by calling different methods on the global <span class="attribute">browser</span> variable within the test.<br/>In the code above we do this by calling the <span class="attribute">.url()</span> method on it which simulates the user navigating to whatever url is passed into the method as its argument.<br/>In the test above we enter <span class="attribute">'/'</span> as the argument which would navigate to the root file of our project which would be something like <span class="code">index.html</span>, alternatively we could enter something like <span class="attribute">browser.url('https://www.google.com;)</span> and it would simulate navigation to google.</td>

                            <td>The next part of our test is to include assertions from Chai to test that the behaviour we receive is the behaviour we are expecting.<br/><br/>We need to require in chai in the usual way;<br/><br/><span class="attribute">const { assert } = require('chai');</span><br/><br/> In the above we bring in the <span class="attribute">assert</span> method using destructured syntax.<br/><br/>Within our code body we can add in the behaviour test now using the assertion method from chai and a couple of helper methods from WebdriverI/O.<br/><br/><span class="attribute">describe('User visits root', () => {<br/>describe('without existing messages', () => {<br/>it('starts blank', () => {<br/>browser.url('/');<br/><br/>assert.equal(browser.getText('#messages'), '');<br/>});<br/>});<br/>});</span><br/><br/>In the above code we want to test that the messages section of the app is empty.<br/>We start off by using the <span class="attribute">assert</span> method and call the <span class="attribute">equal</span>  method from chai on it to ensure that whatever argument we put into this assertion is equal to the behaviour we expect. This way, if the app does what we put in as the argument, the test will pass, if not, then it will fail and we need to debug.<br/>This method expects 2 arguments, one to compare to the other to see if they're equal. It can have a 3rd argument which is optional but this is to provide a custom error message.<br/><br/>The next part of the code is the first argument.<br/>We use the <span class="attribute">browser</span> variable again to access parts of the headless browser. We then append the <span class="attribute">getText()</span> method from WebdriverI/O. This method simply fetches whatever text from the argument inserted into the parentheses.<br/>Lets say our messages item on our website is within a div that has the ID of 'messages'. We add the identifier for that as the argument (<span class="attribute">#messages</span>) and this method will then retrieve whatever text appears in that div.<br/><br/>The second argument is what we want to compare the first argument to. Our test is checking to see if the div is empty so our second argument is an empty string.</td>

                            <td>The tests we've explored so far are fairly simple, but we want to test user interactions.<br/>We can use additional methods from WebdriverI/O to simulate more complex user interactions.<br/><br/>Below is an example test showing how we can simulate a user filling in some text boxes and then clicking submit on a form;<br/><br/><span class="attribute">  describe('posting a message', () => {<br/>it('saves the message with the author information', () => {<br/>const message ='blah blah blah blah';<br/>const author = 'username';<br/><br/>browser.url('/');<br/>browser.setValue('input[id=author]', author);<br/>browser.setValue('textarea[id=message]', message);<br/>browser.click('input[type=submit]');<br/>});<br/>});</span><br/><br/>In the above test we start by assigning some user input into 2 different variables. These will be our simulated user typed input.<br/><br/>Underneath we have our actual simulation.<br/>We start off by navigating to the web page in the same way we did with the previous test (<span class="attribute">browser.url('/');</span>).<br/><br/>We then use a new method (<span class="attribute">.setValue()</span>). This method takes 2 arguments.<br/>The first is the CSS selector that references an HTML element and the second argument is the value we wish to assign to that element.<br/>So in our simulation we select an input box with the ID of 'author'.<br/>The second argument is what we want the simulator to set as the value, so here we use our variable to set the input to read 'username'.<br/><br/>We do the same thing again underneath this for the textarea box for the longer message.<br/><br/>Finally we use another method to simulate the user clicking the submit button by appending the <span class="attribute">.click()</span> method to the <span class="attribute">browser</span> variable.</td>

                            <td>The final portion of the test after mimicking user input is to verify that the process has worked as we expected.<br/>To do this we run an assertion from chai on the element that we expect our results to be in and compare our predefined variables against the result.<br/>This will let us know if the code for our website is performing the desired functions it should be performing.<br/><br/><span class="attribute">  describe('posting a message', () => {<br/>it('saves the message with the author information', () => {<br/><br/>const message ='blah blah blah blah';<br/>const author = 'username';<br/><br/>browser.url('/');<br/>browser.setValue('input[id=author]', author);<br/>browser.setValue('textarea[id=message]', message);<br/>browser.click('input[type=submit]');<br/><br/>assert.include(browser.getText('#messages'), author);<br/>assert.include(browser.getText('#messages'), message);<br/>});<br/>});</span><br/><br/>So in the above code we use 2 different assertions to test if the div that our messages should turn up in contains the expected text.<br/>We already have the expected text contained in the variables we wrote to perform the test so we can just reuse those within the assertion.</td>

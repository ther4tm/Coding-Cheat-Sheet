            <p>Below is a brief list of fundamental CSS tags and a brief description of what they do and any notes on correct syntax.</p>

                <h2>Syntax conventions</h2>
                <p>This section describes tags that are used as tools within the CSS.</p>

                <h2>Selectors</h2>
                <p>To enable attributes to be applied to specific elements the relevant parts of the code need to be targetted. CSS has a number of ways to select specific items within the code through a combination of the methods below.</p>
                <table>
                    <thead>

                            <th>Description</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td><span class="attribute">*</span></td>
                            <td>Universal Selector</td>
                            <td>This is the most wide ranging method of selection. It is essentially the select all parameter. This is usually at the start of the stylesheet as the specificity of the code becomes more complex the further you go into the document.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td><span class="attribute">elementname</span></td>
                            <td>Type Selector</td>
                            <td>This targets HTML type tags. For example <span class="code">p</span> would target all paragraph (<span class="code">&lt;p&gt;</span>) tags.</td>
                        </tr>

                            <td>Class Selector</td>
                            <td>This targets classes that have been defined within the HTML code. Classes are sections of code that are likely to be used multiple times which may require a blanket rule set that differs from the root level element. They can be defined as a supplemental attribute to an element. This allows a greater level of specificity when targetting elements within the page. For example as above, <span class="code">p</span> would target all paragraph (<span class="code">&lt;p&gt;</span>) tags however, by writing a class based rule you can further define additional attributes or override the original rules.</td>
                        </tr>

                            <td>ID Selector</td>
                            <td>This targets elements that have been further defined with an <span class="attribute">id</span> attribute. An <span class="attribute">id</span> is intended to be used in a more sporadic and less frequent way than classes. They can be nested within a class to give further specificity when writing rules.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td><span class="attribute">*[attr=value]</span></td>
                            <td>Attribute Selector</td>
                            <td>This targets very specific elements within the code. The syntax is written so that it selects a specific value of a specific attribute of the preceeding element and applies the rules to that item. Within this there is syntax to further specify how and when the attributes are relevant. For example <span class="code">a[href="https://example.org"]</span> will select and apply rules to all links that contain "https://example.org".</td>

                            <td>This defines the colour of the text to be used for the selected element. This can be defined in numerous ways. Keywords can be used that describe pre-set colours such as <span class="attribute">aqua</span>. RGB values can be used and are noted in the syntax as <span class="attribute">rgb(253, 30, 56)</span>. Hexadecimal can also be used to define the colour, the syntax for this is <span class="attribute">#ff0000</span>. Opacity can also be controlled, for example the syntax to give 50% opacity using rgb is <span class="attribute">rgb(253, 30, 56, 0.5)</span>.</td>

When defining an image it always best practice to define a <span class="attribute">background-color</span> aswell just in case the image fails to load or is unavailable.</td>

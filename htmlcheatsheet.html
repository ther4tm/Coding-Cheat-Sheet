                            <td><span class="attribute">type="number"</span></td>
                            <td>This allows for the input of numbers. It will not accept non numerical input, acting as a quick front end validation tool.<br/><br/>This attribute also allows for additional functionality to be used within the <span class="code">&lt;input&gt;</span> tag.<br/>A <span class="attribute">min="1"</span> and <span class="attribute">max="10"</span> attribute can be used to ensure that the user input is kept within the defined range, in this case between 1 and 10.<br/><br/>A further attribute that can be used with this is the <span class="attribute">step="1"</span> property. When a number input field is defined it will enter with an increase and decrease arrow button within the input field that will allow a user to increase or decrease the number. The <span class="attribute">step</span> defines how much this arrow increases or decreases the number. So for example if we want the arrows to increase/decrease by 10 each time it is pressed we would define <span class="attribute">step="10"</span></td>
